        <p>NEW DELHI: The second half of the budget session is just days away from a washout, having transacted little more than the passage of the Union Budget, even as the chaotic scenes in the Rajya Sabha worsened on Monday with almost the entire opposition trooping into the well, forcing Chairman Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the House in minutes.
            Even by the tumultuous record of the past weeks, the well of the House was swamped as parties pressed causes ranging from Cauvery water to the Supreme Court ruling on the SC/ST Act in the midst of a melee.
            No significant business has been transacted by the two Houses in the last 18 days, making the current period one of the least productive in the 16th Lok Sabha.</p>

        <p>LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday that he will attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next week, reversing his previous decision to skip the meeting in Sharm El Sheikh to focus on domestic issues and the economic crisis in the UK.

            Sunak took to Twitter to reveal his plans after criticism from climate activists and within the government from Indian-origin COP27 President Alok Sharma, who said it was important for the prime minister to be present to show the UK's commitment on the issue of climate action.
            
            The pressure mounted further as his ex-boss, former prime minister Boris Johnson, confirmed that he would be attending the summit scheduled between November 6 and 18.
            "There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change, tweeted Sunak.

            "There is no energy security without investing in renewables. That is why I will attend COP27 next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future," he said, with reference to the COP26 summit chaired by the UK in Scotland last November.
            
            The Opposition Labour Party described the reversed decision to attend as Sunak being "dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing; embarrassing".
            
            The Green Party called it a "screeching U-turn" and "an embarrassing mis-step on the world stage" to initially announce plans not to attend.
            
            Earlier this week, Downing Street said Sunak's attendance at the summit was under review as progress was being made with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on the preparation of a crucial economic statement scheduled for November 17.</p>

        <h3><b>'Win for PM Modi's social justice mission': BJP after SC upholds Centre's 10% reservation to EWS</b></h3>
        <h5>Last Updated: Nov 07, 2022, 04:16 PM IST</h5>

        <p>New Delhi: As the Supreme Court on Monday (November 7, 2022) upheld the economically weaker sections (EWS) quota, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lauded the decision and said it is a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his "mission" to provide social justice to the country's poor. The top court, by a majority view of 3:2, upheld the validity of the 103rd Constitution amendment providing 10 per cent reservation to people belonging to EWS in admissions and government jobs.

            BJP general secretary CT Ravi said the verdict is yet another victory for Modi in his mission to provide social justice to India's poor.
            
            "The Constitution bench of the Supreme Court upholds the validity of the 10 per cent EWS reservation amongst the General Category. This is yet another victory for PM Shri Narendra Modi in his mission to provide social justice to India's poor," he said in a tweet.</p>

        <h3><b>Elon Musk claims that he is buying Twitter to "help humanity" as the billionaire set out his aims for taking over the social media platform.</b></h3>
        <h5>27 October</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg" >
            <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17DA4/production/_127400779_muskgetty.png.webp" width="120%" alt="img">
        </div>
        <p>In a tweet, Mr Musk said he didn't buy the firm "to make more money. I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love".

            The entrepreneur has until Friday to complete a $44bn (£38bn) takeover of Twitter or risk going to trial.
            
            The tweet addressed to Twitter's advertisers states that he has "acquired" the firm.However, there has been no official confirmation that the deal has been completed.

            Earlier this week, Mr Musk published a video of himself walking into Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink, raising speculation about his aims for the firm.
            
            "Entering Twitter HQ - let that sink in!" Mr Musk wrote.
            
            In business parlance, "kitchen sinking" means taking radical action at a company, though it is not clear if this was Mr Musk's message - he also updated his Twitter bio to read "chief twit".
            
            In his latest tweet, Mr Musk set out some of his goals for the company, saying that Twitter must be "warm and welcoming for all".
            
            He wrote that he wanted "civilization to have a common digital town square" but he denies the platform will take an anything-goes approach.
            
            "Twitter cannot become a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences!" He also said the platform must adhere to the laws of the land.

Mr Musk has said the social media site needs significant changes.

It was not clear whether Mr Musk met Twitter executives Wednesday when he made his trip with the sink but he listed his location as the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco on the social media platform.

When Mr Musk first revealed plans to buy Twitter, he said he wanted to clean up spam accounts on the platform and preserve it as a venue for free speech.

But Mr Musk, the world's richest man and a prolific Twitter user known for his impulsive style, baulked at the purchase just a few weeks later, citing concerns that the number of fake accounts on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.

Twitter executives denied the accusations, arguing that Mr Musk wanted out because he was worried about the price.</p>
